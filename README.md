# predicting-readmission-diabetic-patients
This Is a repository for Predicting Readmssion in patients with diabeties using various machine learning classification Models. 
Data for this project was acquired from Kaggle. 
The raw dara contain n=101766 and 50 variables.
Data Preprocessing and Model Building is done using Python.
This project was previous done using R and is currently being translated to python. 
Currently tranlating this code in python and then will perform various hyperparameter tuning techniques to improve model performance. 
The end goal of this project is to productionize this code such that it can be used for predicting readmission in diabetic patients.
